<p style="top:248px;left:57px;" class="ft123">The demands made by a work of this nature upon the generos-<br/>ity of specialists are very numerous, and the Editor would be <br/>wanting in all title to the generous treatment he has received <br/>were he not willing to make the fullest possible acknowledge-<br/>ment of his indebtedness.</p>
<p style="top:353px;left:70px;" class="ft120">His thanks are due in the first place to the scholarly and </p>
<p style="top:374px;left:57px;" class="ft122">accomplished Bahadur Shah, baggage elephant 174 on the <br/>Indian Register, who, with his amiable sister Pudmini, most <br/>courteously supplied the history of ‘Toomai of the Elephants’ <br/>and much of the information contained in ‘Servants of the <br/>Queen’. The adventures of Mowgli were collected at various <br/>times and in various places from a multitude of informants, <br/>most of whom desire to preserve the strictest anonymity. Yet, <br/>at this distance, the Editor feels at liberty to thank a Hindu <br/>gentleman of the old rock, an esteemed resident of the upper <br/>slopes of Jakko, for his convincing if somewhat caustic esti-<br/>mate of the national characteristics of his caste – the Presbytes. <br/>Sahi, a savant of infinite research and industry, a member of <br/>the recently disbanded Seoni Pack and an artist well known at <br/>most of the local fairs of southern India, where his muzzled <br/>dance with his master attracts the youth, beauty and culture of <br/>many villages, have contributed most valuable data on people, <br/>manners and customs. These have been freely drawn upon, in <br/>the stories of ‘Tiger-Tiger!’ ‘Kaa’s Hunting’ and ‘Mowgli’s <br/>Brothers’. For the outlines of ‘Rikki-tikki-tavi’ the Editor stands </p>

A happy accident <br/>of travel enabled the Editor, when a passenger on the <i>Empress <br/>of  India</i>, to be of some slight assistance to a fellow voyager. <br/>How richly his poor services were repaid, readers of the ‘White <br/>Seal’ may judge for themselves.</p>

<p style="top:659px;left:56px;"  class="ft143">It was seven o’Clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee<br/>hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day’s rest, scratched </p>
<p style="top:710px;left:57px;"  class="ft146">himself, yawned and spread out his paws one after the other to <br/>get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with <br/>her big grey nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing </p>

<p style="top:43px;left:202px;" class="ft150">the jungle books</p>
<p style="top:80px;left:57px;" class="ft153">cubs, and the moon into the mouth of the cave where they all <br/>lived. “Augrh!” said Father Wolf, “it is time to hunt again”; and <br/>he was going to spring downhill when a little shadow with a <br/>bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: “Good luck go <br/>with you, O Chief of the Wolves; and good luck and strong <br/>white teeth go with the noble children, that they may never <br/>forget the hungry in this world.”</p>
<p style="top:227px;left:70px;" class="ft150">It was the jackal – Tabaqui, the Dish-licker – and the wolves </p>
<p style="top:248px;left:57px;" class="ft152">of India despise Tabaqui, because he runs about making mis-<br/>chief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather <br/>from the village rubbish heaps. But they are afraid of him too, <br/>because Tabaqui, more than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to <br/>go mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone, <br/>and runs through the forest biting everything in his way. Even <br/>the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for <br/>madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild <br/>creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it <i>dewanee</i> – the <br/>madness – and run.</p>
<p style="top:458px;left:70px;" class="ft150">“Enter, then, and look,” said Father Wolf stiffly, “but there </p>
<p style="top:479px;left:57px;" class="ft150">is no food here.”</p>
<p style="top:500px;left:70px;" class="ft150">“For a wolf, no,” said Tabaqui, “but for so mean a person as </p>
<p style="top:521px;left:57px;" class="ft152">myself a dry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log <br/>[the jackal people], to pick and choose?” He scuttled to the <br/>back of the cave, where he found the bone of a buck with some <br/>meat on it, and sat cracking the end merrily.</p>
<p style="top:605px;left:70px;" class="ft150">“All thanks for this good meal,” he said, licking his lips. “How </p>
<p style="top:626px;left:57px;" class="ft153">beautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And <br/>so young too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that <br/>the children of kings are men from the beginning.”</p>
<p style="top:689px;left:70px;" class="ft150">Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is </p>
<p style="top:710px;left:57px;" class="ft152">nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces, <br/>and it pleased him to see Mother and Father Wolf look <br/>uncomfortable.</p>

<p style="top:43px;left:195px;"  class="ft160">mowgli’s brothers</p>
<p style="top:80px;left:70px;"   class="ft160">Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, </p>
<p style="top:101px;left:57px;"  class="ft160">and then he said spitefully:</p>
<p style="top:122px;left:70px;"  class="ft160">“Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting grounds. </p>
<p style="top:143px;left:57px;"  class="ft162">He will hunt among these hills for the next moon, so he has <br/>told me.”</p>
<p style="top:185px;left:70px;"  class="ft160">Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, </p>
<p style="top:206px;left:57px;"  class="ft160">twenty miles away.</p>
<p style="top:227px;left:70px;"  class="ft160">“He has no right!” Father Wolf began angrily. “By the Law </p>
<p style="top:248px;left:57px;"  class="ft162">of the Jungle he has no right to change his quarters without <br/>due warning. He will frighten every head of game within ten <br/>miles, and I – I have to kill for two these days.”</p>
<p style="top:311px;left:70px;"  class="ft160">“His mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for </p>
<p style="top:332px;left:57px;"  class="ft162">nothing,” said Mother Wolf quietly. “He has been lame in <br/>one foot from his birth. That is why he has only killed cattle. <br/>Now the villagers of the Waingunga are angry with him, and <br/>he has come here to make <i>our</i> villagers angry. They will scour <br/>the jungle for him when he is far away, and we and our chil-<br/>dren must run when the grass is set alight. Indeed, we are very <br/>grateful to Shere Khan!”</p>
<p style="top:479px;left:70px;"  class="ft163">“Shall I tell him of your gratitude?” said Tabaqui.<br/>“Out!” snapped Father Wolf. “Out and hunt with thy master. </p>
<p style="top:521px;left:57px;"  class="ft160">Thou hast done harm enough for one night.”</p>
<p style="top:542px;left:70px;"  class="ft160">“I go,” said Tabaqui quietly. “Ye can hear Shere Khan below </p>
<p style="top:563px;left:57px;"  class="ft160">in the thickets. I might have saved myself the message.”</p>
<p style="top:584px;left:70px;"  class="ft160">Father Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down </p>
<p style="top:605px;left:57px;"  class="ft162">to a little river, he heard the dry, angry, snarly, sing-song whine <br/>of a tiger who has caught nothing and does not care if all the <br/>jungle knows it.</p>
<p style="top:668px;left:70px;"  class="ft160">“The fool!” said Father Wolf. “To begin a night’s work </p>
<p style="top:689px;left:57px;"  class="ft162">with that noise! Does he think that our buck are like his fat <br/>Waingunga bullocks?”</p>
<p style="top:731px;left:70px;"  class="ft160">“H’sh. It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts tonight,” said </p>
<p style="top:752px;left:57px;"  class="ft160">Mother Wolf. “It is Man.” The whine had changed to a sort </p>

<p style="top:43px;left:202px;"  class="ft170">the jungle books</p>
<p style="top:80px;left:57px;"   class="ft171">of humming purr that seemed to come from every quarter of <br/>the compass. It was the noise that bewilders woodcutters and <br/>gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run sometimes <br/>into the very mouth of the tiger.</p>
<p style="top:164px;left:70px;"  class="ft170">“Man!” said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. “Faugh! </p>
<p style="top:185px;left:57px;"  class="ft171">Are there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he <br/>must eat Man, and on our ground too!”</p>
<p style="top:227px;left:70px;"  class="ft170">The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a </p>
<p style="top:248px;left:57px;"  class="ft171">reason, forbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing <br/>to show his children how to kill, and then he must hunt outside <br/>the hunting grounds of his pack or tribe. The real reason for this <br/>is that man-killing means, sooner or later, the arrival of white <br/>men on elephants, with guns, and hundreds of brown men with <br/>gongs and rockets and torches. Then everybody in the jungle <br/>suffers. The reason the beasts give among themselves is that <br/>Man is the weakest and most defenceless of all living things, <br/>and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too – and it <br/>is true – that man-eaters become mangy and lose their teeth.</p>
<p style="top:458px;left:70px;"  class="ft170">The purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated “Aaarh!” </p>
<p style="top:479px;left:57px;"  class="ft170">of the tiger’s charge.</p>
<p style="top:500px;left:70px;"  class="ft170">Then there was a howl – an untigerish howl – from Shere </p>
<p style="top:521px;left:57px;"  class="ft170">Khan. “He has missed,” said Mother Wolf. “What is it?”</p>
<p style="top:542px;left:70px;"  class="ft170">Father Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere Khan mut-</p>
<p style="top:563px;left:57px;"  class="ft170">tering and mumbling savagely, as he tumbled about in the scrub.</p>

<p style="top:647px;left:70px;"  class="ft170">“Something is coming uphill,” said Mother Wolf, twitching </p>

<p style="top:689px;left:70px;"  class="ft170">The bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf </p>
<p style="top:710px;left:57px;"  class="ft172">dropped with his haunches under him, ready for his leap. Then, if <br/>you had been watching, you would have seen the most wonderful <br/>thing in the world – the wolf checked in mid-spring. He made his </p>

<p style="top:80px;left:57px;"   class="ft181">bound before he saw what it was he was jumping at, and then he <br/>tried to stop himself. The result was that he shot up straight into <br/>the air for four or five feet, landing almost where he left ground.</p>
<p style="top:143px;left:70px;"  class="ft182">“Man!” he snapped. “A man’s cub. Look!”<br/>Directly in front of him, holding on by a low branch, stood a </p>
<p style="top:185px;left:57px;"  class="ft181">naked brown baby who could just walk – as soft and as dimpled <br/>a little atom as ever came to a wolf’s cave at night. He looked <br/>up into Father Wolf’s face, and laughed.</p>
<p style="top:248px;left:70px;"  class="ft180">“Is that a man’s cub?” said Mother Wolf. “I have never seen </p>
<p style="top:269px;left:57px;"  class="ft180">one. Bring it here.”</p>
<p style="top:290px;left:70px;"  class="ft180">A wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, </p>
<p style="top:311px;left:57px;"  class="ft182">mouth an egg without breaking it, and though Father Wolf’s <br/>jaws closed right on the child’s back not a tooth even scratched <br/>the skin, as he laid it down among the cubs.</p>
<p style="top:374px;left:70px;"  class="ft180">“How little! How naked, and – how bold!” said Mother Wolf </p>
<p style="top:395px;left:57px;"  class="ft181">softly. The baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get <br/>close to the warm hide. “Ahai! He is taking his meal with the <br/>others. And so this is a man’s cub. Now, was there ever a wolf <br/>that could boast of a man’s cub among her children?”</p>
<p style="top:479px;left:70px;"  class="ft180">“I have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in </p>
<p style="top:500px;left:57px;"  class="ft182">our Pack or in my time,” said Father Wolf. “He is altogether <br/>without hair, and I could kill him with a touch of my foot. But <br/>see, he looks up and is not afraid.”</p>
<p style="top:563px;left:70px;"  class="ft180">The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, </p>
<p style="top:584px;left:57px;"  class="ft181">for Shere Khan’s great square head and shoulders were thrust <br/>into the entrance. Tabaqui, behind him, was squeaking: “My <br/>lord, my lord, it went in here!”</p>
<p style="top:647px;left:70px;"  class="ft180">“Shere Khan does us great honour,” said Father Wolf, but his </p>
<p style="top:668px;left:57px;"  class="ft180">eyes were very angry. “What does Shere Khan need?”</p>
<p style="top:689px;left:70px;"  class="ft180">“My quarry. A man’s cub went this way,” said Shere Khan. </p>
<p style="top:710px;left:57px;"  class="ft180">“Its parents have run off. Give it to me.”</p>
<p style="top:731px;left:70px;"  class="ft180">Shere Khan had jumped at a woodcutters’ campfire, as Father </p>

<p style="top:164px;left:70px;" class="ft190">“The Wolves are a free people,” said Father Wolf. “They take </p>
<p style="top:185px;left:57px;" class="ft192">orders from the Head of the Pack, and not from any striped <br/>cattle killer. The man’s cub is ours – to kill if we choose.”</p>
<p style="top:227px;left:70px;" class="ft190">“Ye choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choos-</p>
<p style="top:248px;left:57px;" class="ft192">ing? By the bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your <br/>dog’s den for my fair dues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!”</p>
<p style="top:290px;left:70px;" class="ft190">The tiger’s roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf </p>
<p style="top:311px;left:57px;" class="ft192">shook herself clear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes, <br/>like two green moons in the darkness, facing the blazing eyes <br/>of Shere Khan.</p>
<p style="top:374px;left:70px;" class="ft190">“And it is I, Raksha [The Demon], who answer. The man’s </p>
<p style="top:395px;left:57px;" class="ft192">cub is mine, Lungri – mine to me! He shall not be killed. He <br/>shall live to run with the Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and <br/>in the end, look you, hunter of little naked cubs – frog-eater <br/>– fish-killer – he shall hunt <i>thee</i>! Now get hence, or by the <br/>Sambhur that I killed (I eat no starved cattle), back thou goest <br/>to thy mother, burnt beast of the jungle, lamer than ever thou <br/>camest into the world! Go!”</p>
<p style="top:542px;left:70px;" class="ft190">Father Wolf looked on amazed. He had almost forgotten </p>
<p style="top:563px;left:57px;" class="ft192">the days when he won Mother Wolf in fair fight from five <br/>other wolves, when she ran in the Pack and was not called the <br/>Demon for compliment’s sake. Shere Khan might have faced <br/>Father Wolf, but he could not stand up against Mother Wolf, <br/>for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of <br/>the ground and would fight to the death. So he backed out of <br/>the cave mouth growling, and when he was clear he shouted:</p>
<p style="top:710px;left:70px;" class="ft190">“Each dog barks in his own yard! We will see what the Pack </p>
<p style="top:731px;left:57px;" class="ft192">will say to this fostering of man cubs. The cub is mine, and <br/>to my teeth he will come in the end, O bush-tailed thieves!”</p>

<p style="top:80px;left:70px;"   class="ft200">Mother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, </p>
<p style="top:101px;left:57px;"  class="ft200">and Father Wolf said to her gravely:</p>
<p style="top:122px;left:70px;"  class="ft200">“Shere Khan speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown </p>
<p style="top:143px;left:57px;"  class="ft200">to the Pack. Wilt thou still keep him, Mother?”</p>
<p style="top:164px;left:70px;"  class="ft200">“Keep him!” she gasped. “He came naked, by night, alone and </p>
<p style="top:185px;left:57px;"  class="ft201">very hungry; yet he was not afraid! Look, he has pushed one <br/>of my babes to one side already. And that lame butcher would <br/>have killed him and would have run off to the Waingunga while <br/>the villagers here hunted through all our lairs in revenge! Keep <br/>him? Assuredly I will keep him. Lie still, little frog. O thou <br/>Mowgli – for Mowgli the Frog I will call thee – the time will <br/>come when thou wilt hunt Shere Khan as he has hunted thee.”</p>
<p style="top:332px;left:70px;"  class="ft201">“But what will our Pack say?” said Father Wolf.<br/>The Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf </p>
<p style="top:374px;left:57px;"  class="ft201">may, when he marries, withdraw from the Pack he belongs to; <br/>but as soon as his cubs are old enough to stand on their feet he <br/>must bring them to the Pack Council, which is generally held <br/>once a month at full moon, in order that the other wolves may <br/>identify them. After that inspection the cubs are free to run <br/>where they please, and until they have killed their first buck no <br/>excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the Pack kills one of them. <br/>The punishment is death where the murderer can be found – <br/>and if you think for a minute you will see that this must be so.</p>
<p style="top:563px;left:70px;"  class="ft200">Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then </p>
<p style="top:584px;left:57px;"  class="ft202">on the night of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and <br/>Mother Wolf to the Council Rock – a hilltop covered with <br/>stones and boulders where a hundred wolves could hide. Akela, <br/>the great grey Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and <br/>cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and below him sat <br/>forty or more wolves of every size and colour, from badger-<br/>coloured veterans who could handle a buck alone to young <br/>black three-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone Wolf <br/>had led them for a year now. He had fallen twice into a wolf </p>

There <br/>was very little talking at the rock. The cubs tumbled over each <br/>other in the centre of the circle where their mothers and fathers <br/>sat, and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a <br/>cub, look at him carefully and return to his place on noiseless <br/>feet. Sometimes a mother would push her cub far out into the <br/>moonlight, to be sure that he had not been overlooked. Akela <br/>from his rock would cry: “Ye know the Law – ye know the Law. <br/>Look well, O Wolves!” and the anxious mothers would take <br/>up the call: “Look – look well, O Wolves!”</p>
<p style="top:311px;left:70px;"  class="ft210">At last – and Mother Wolf’s neck bristles lifted as the time </p>
<p style="top:332px;left:57px;"  class="ft211">came – Father Wolf pushed “Mowgli the Frog”, as they called <br/>him, into the centre, where he sat laughing and playing with <br/>some pebbles that glistened in the moonlight.</p>
<p style="top:395px;left:70px;"  class="ft210">Akela never raised his head from his paws, but went on with </p>
<p style="top:416px;left:57px;"  class="ft211">the monotonous cry: “Look well!” A muffled roar came up <br/>from behind the rocks – the voice of Shere Khan crying: “The <br/>cub is mine. Give him to me. What have the Free People to do <br/>with a man’s cub?” Akela never even twitched his ears: all he <br/>said was: “Look well, O Wolves! What have the Free People <br/>to do with the orders of any save the Free People? Look well!”</p>
<p style="top:542px;left:70px;"  class="ft210">There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his </p>
<p style="top:563px;left:57px;"  class="ft211">fourth year flung back Shere Khan’s question to Akela: “What <br/>have the Free People to do with a man’s cub?” Now the Law <br/>of the Jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the <br/>right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he must be spoken <br/>for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his father <br/>and mother.</p>
<p style="top:689px;left:70px;"  class="ft210">“Who speaks for this cub?” said Akela. “Among the Free </p>
<p style="top:710px;left:57px;"  class="ft211">People who speaks?” There was no answer, and Mother Wolf <br/>got ready for what she knew would be her last fight, if things <br/>came to fighting.</p>

<p style="top:101px;left:57px;"  class="ft223">Council – Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf <br/>cubs the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and <br/>go where he pleases, because he eats only nuts and roots and <br/>honey – rose up on his hindquarters and grunted.</p>
<p style="top:185px;left:70px;"  class="ft220">“The man’s cub – the man’s cub?” he said. “<i>I</i> speak for the </p>
<p style="top:206px;left:57px;"  class="ft223">man’s cub. There is no harm in a man’s cub. I have no gift of <br/>words, but I speak the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and <br/>be entered with the others. I myself will teach him.”</p>
<p style="top:269px;left:70px;"  class="ft220">“We need yet another,” said Akela. “Baloo has spoken, and he </p>
<p style="top:290px;left:57px;"  class="ft220">is our teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks beside Baloo?”</p>
<p style="top:311px;left:70px;"  class="ft220">A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera </p>
<p style="top:332px;left:57px;"  class="ft223">the Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther <br/>markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of <br/>watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared <br/>to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as <br/>the wild buffalo and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But <br/>he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree and <br/>a skin softer than down.</p>
<p style="top:479px;left:70px;"  class="ft220">“O Akela, and ye the Free People,” he purred, “I have no </p>
<p style="top:500px;left:57px;"  class="ft222">right in your assembly; but the Law of the Jungle says that if <br/>there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a <br/>new cub, the life of that cub may be bought at a price. And <br/>the Law does not say who may or may not pay that price. <br/>Am I right?”</p>
<p style="top:605px;left:70px;"  class="ft220">“Good! Good!” said the young wolves, who are always hungry. </p>
<p style="top:626px;left:57px;"  class="ft223">“Listen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is <br/>the Law.”</p>
<p style="top:668px;left:70px;"  class="ft223">“Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.”<br/>“Speak then,” cried twenty voices.<br/>“To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better </p>

<p style="top:80px;left:57px;"   class="ft231">killed, not half a mile from here, if ye will accept the man’s <br/>cub according to the Law. Is it difficult?”</p>
<p style="top:122px;left:70px;"  class="ft230">There was a clamour of scores of voices, saying: “What </p>
<p style="top:143px;left:57px;"  class="ft231">matter? He will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the <br/>sun. What harm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the <br/>Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.” And <br/>then came Akela’s deep bay, crying: “Look well – look well, <br/>O Wolves!”</p>
<p style="top:248px;left:70px;"  class="ft230">Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did </p>
<p style="top:269px;left:57px;"  class="ft231">not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by <br/>one. At last they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and <br/>only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo and Mowgli’s own wolves were <br/>left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for he was very angry <br/>that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.</p>
<p style="top:374px;left:70px;"  class="ft230">“Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, under his whiskers, “for </p>
<p style="top:395px;left:57px;"  class="ft231">the time comes when this naked thing will make thee roar to <br/>another tune, or I know nothing of man.”</p>
<p style="top:437px;left:70px;"  class="ft230">“It was well done,” said Akela. “Men and their cubs are very </p>
<p style="top:458px;left:57px;"  class="ft230">wise. He may be a help in time.”</p>
<p style="top:479px;left:70px;"  class="ft230">“Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the </p>
<p style="top:500px;left:57px;"  class="ft230">Pack for ever,” said Bagheera.</p>
<p style="top:521px;left:70px;"  class="ft230">Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes </p>
<p style="top:542px;left:57px;"  class="ft231">to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him <br/>and he gets feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the <br/>wolves and a new leader comes up – to be killed in his turn.</p>
<p style="top:605px;left:70px;"  class="ft230">“Take him away,” he said to Father Wolf, “and train him as </p>
<p style="top:626px;left:57px;"  class="ft230">befits one of the Free People.”</p>
<p style="top:647px;left:70px;"  class="ft230">And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seoni wolf pack </p>
<p style="top:668px;left:57px;"  class="ft230">for the price of a bull and on Baloo’s good word.</p>
<p style="top:689px;left:70px;"  class="ft230">Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, </p>
<p style="top:710px;left:57px;"  class="ft232">and only guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among <br/>the wolves, because if it were written out it would fill ever so <br/>many books. He grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, </p>

<p style="top:80px;left:57px;" class="ft241">were grown wolves almost before he was a child, and Father <br/>Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things in <br/>the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the <br/>warm night air, every note of the owls above his head, every <br/>scratch of a bat’s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree and <br/>every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just <br/>as much to him as the work of his office means to a business-<br/>man. When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, <br/>and ate and went to sleep again; when he felt dirty or hot he <br/>swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo <br/>told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as <br/>raw meat) he climbed up for it – and that Bagheera showed <br/>him how to do. Bagheera would lie out on a branch and call, <br/>“Come along, Little Brother,” and at first Mowgli would cling <br/>like the sloth, but afterwards he would fling himself through <br/>the branches almost as boldly as the grey ape. He took his <br/>place at the Council Rock too, when the Pack met, and there <br/>he discovered that if he stared hard at any wolf, the wolf would <br/>be forced to drop his eyes, and so he used to stare for fun. At <br/>other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads of <br/>his friends, for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in <br/>their coats. He would go down the hillside into the cultivated <br/>lands by night, and look very curiously at the villagers in their <br/>huts, but he had a mistrust of men, because Bagheera showed <br/>him a square box with a drop gate so cunningly hidden in the <br/>jungle that he nearly walked into it and told him that it was a <br/>trap. He loved better than anything else to go with Bagheera <br/>into the dark warm heart of the forest, to sleep all through <br/>the drowsy day and at night see how Bagheera did his killing. <br/>Bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry, and so did <br/>Mowgli – with one exception. As soon as he was old enough <br/>to understand things, Bagheera told him that he must never <br/>touch cattle, because he had been bought into the Pack at the </p>

<p style="top:80px;left:57px;" class="ft251">price of a bull’s life. “All the jungle is thine,” said Bagheera, <br/>“and thou canst kill everything that thou art strong enough to <br/>kill; but for the sake of the bull that bought thee, thou must <br/>never kill or eat any cattle young or old. That is the Law of <br/>the Jungle.” Mowgli obeyed faithfully.</p>
<p style="top:185px;left:70px;" class="ft250">And he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does </p>
<p style="top:206px;left:57px;" class="ft252">not know that he is learning any lessons, and who has nothing <br/>in the world to think of except things to eat.</p>
<p style="top:248px;left:70px;" class="ft250">Mother Wolf told him once or twice that Shere Khan was </p>
<p style="top:269px;left:57px;" class="ft251">not a creature to be trusted, and that some day he must kill <br/>Shere Khan; but though a young wolf would have remembered <br/>that advice every hour, Mowgli forgot it because he was only <br/>a boy – though he would have called himself a wolf if he had <br/>been able to speak in any human tongue.</p>
<p style="top:374px;left:70px;" class="ft250">Shere Khan was always crossing his path in the jungle, for </p>
<p style="top:395px;left:57px;" class="ft251">as Akela grew older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be <br/>great friends with the younger wolves of the Pack, who followed <br/>him for scraps, a thing Akela would never have allowed if he <br/>had dared to push his authority to the proper bounds. Then <br/>Shere Khan would flatter them and wonder that such fine young <br/>hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a man’s <br/>cub. “They tell me,” Shere Khan would say, “that at Council ye <br/>dare not look him between the eyes” – and the young wolves <br/>would growl and bristle.</p>
<p style="top:584px;left:70px;" class="ft250">Bagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something </p>
<p style="top:605px;left:57px;" class="ft251">of this, and once or twice he told Mowgli in so many words <br/>that Shere Khan would kill him some day; and Mowgli would <br/>laugh and answer: “I have the Pack and I have thee – and Baloo, <br/>though he is so lazy, might strike a blow or two for my sake. <br/>Why should I be afraid?”</p>
<p style="top:710px;left:70px;" class="ft250">It was one very warm day that a new notion came to Bagheera </p>

<p style="top:143px;left:70px;" class="ft260">“As many times as there are nuts on that palm,” said Mowgli, </p>
<p style="top:164px;left:57px;" class="ft262">who, naturally, could not count. “What of it? I am sleepy, <br/>Bagheera, and Shere Khan is all long tail and loud talk – like <br/>Mor the Peacock.”</p>
<p style="top:227px;left:70px;" class="ft260">“But this is no time for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know </p>
<p style="top:248px;left:57px;" class="ft262">it; the Pack know it; and even the foolish, foolish deer know. <br/>Tabaqui had told thee too.”</p>
<p style="top:290px;left:70px;" class="ft260">“Ho! Ho!” said Mowgli. “Tabaqui came to me not long ago </p>
<p style="top:311px;left:57px;" class="ft261">with some rude talk that I was a naked man’s cub and not fit <br/>to dig pignuts; but I caught Tabaqui by the tail and swung him <br/>twice against a palm tree to teach him better manners.”</p>
<p style="top:374px;left:70px;" class="ft260">“That was foolishness, for though Tabaqui is a mischief-</p>
<p style="top:395px;left:57px;" class="ft261">maker, he would have told thee of something that concerned <br/>thee closely. Open those eyes, Little Brother. Shere Khan dare <br/>not kill thee in the jungle, but remember, Akela is very old, and <br/>soon the day comes when he cannot kill his buck, and then he <br/>will be leader no more. Many of the wolves that looked thee <br/>over when thou wast brought to the Council first are old too, <br/>and the young wolves believe, as Shere Khan has taught them, <br/>that a man cub has no place with the Pack. In a little time thou <br/>wilt be a man.”</p>
<p style="top:584px;left:70px;" class="ft260">“And what is a man that he should not run with his broth-</p>
<p style="top:605px;left:57px;" class="ft262">ers?” said Mowgli. “I was born in the jungle. I have obeyed the <br/>Law of the Jungle, and there is no wolf of ours from whose <br/>paws I have not pulled a thorn. Surely they are my brothers!”</p>
<p style="top:668px;left:70px;" class="ft260">Bagheera stretched himself at full length and half-shut his </p>

It <br/>was because of this that I paid the price for thee at the Council <br/>when thou wast a little naked cub. Yes, I too was born among <br/>men. I had never seen the jungle. They fed me behind bars <br/>from an iron pan till one night I felt that I was Bagheera – the <br/>Panther – and no man’s plaything, and I broke the silly lock <br/>with one blow of my paw and came away; and because I had <br/>learnt the ways of men, I became more terrible in the jungle <br/>than Shere Khan. Is it not so?”</p>
<p style="top:332px;left:70px;"  class="ft270">“Yes,” said Mowgli, “all the jungle fear Bagheera – all except </p>

<p style="top:458px;left:70px;"  class="ft272">“But why – but why should any wish to kill me?” said Mowgli.<br/>“Look at me,” said Bagheera – and Mowgli looked at him </p>
<p style="top:500px;left:57px;"  class="ft273">steadily between the eyes. The big panther turned his head <br/>away in half a minute.</p>

<p style="top:668px;left:70px;"  class="ft270">“I did not know these things,” said Mowgli sullenly, and he </p>
<p style="top:689px;left:57px;"  class="ft270">frowned under his heavy black eyebrows.</p>

They will hold a <br/>jungle Council at the Rock, and then – and then – I have it!” <br/>said Bagheera, leaping up. “Go thou down quickly to the men’s <br/>huts in the valley, and take some of the Red Flower which they <br/>grow there, so that when the time comes thou mayest have even <br/>a stronger friend than I or Baloo or those of the Pack that love <br/>thee.

<p style="top:248px;left:70px;"  class="ft280">By Red Flower Bagheera meant fire, only no creature in the </p>
<p style="top:269px;left:57px;"  class="ft281">jungle will call fire by its proper name. Every beast lives in <br/>deadly fear of it, and invents a hundred ways of describing it.</p>
<p style="top:311px;left:70px;"  class="ft280">“The Red Flower?” said Mowgli. “That grows outside their </p>

<p style="top:353px;left:70px;"  class="ft280">“There speaks the man’s cub,” said Bagheera proudly. </p>
<p style="top:374px;left:57px;"  class="ft281">“Remember that it grows in little pots. Get one swiftly, and <br/>keep it by thee for time of need.”</p>
<p style="top:416px;left:70px;"  class="ft280">“Good!” said Mowgli. “I go. But art thou sure, O my </p>
<p style="top:437px;left:57px;"  class="ft281">Bagheera” – he slipped his arm round the splendid neck and <br/>looked deep into the big eyes – “art thou sure that all this is <br/>Shere Khan’s doing?”</p>
<p style="top:500px;left:70px;"  class="ft282">“By the Broken Lock that freed me, I am sure, Little Brother.”<br/>“Then, by the Bull that bought me, I will pay Shere Khan </p>

<p style="top:584px;left:70px;"  class="ft280">“That is a man. That is all a man,” said Bagheera to himself, </p>
<p style="top:605px;left:57px;"  class="ft282">lying down again. “Oh, Shere Khan, never was a blacker hunt-<br/>ing than that frog hunt of thine ten years ago!”</p>
<p style="top:647px;left:70px;"  class="ft280">Mowgli was far and far through the forest, running hard, </p>
<p style="top:668px;left:57px;"  class="ft281">and his heart was hot in him. He came to the cave as the even-<br/>ing mist rose, and drew breath, and looked down the valley. <br/>The cubs were out, but Mother Wolf, at the back of the cave, <br/>knew by his breathing that something was troubling her frog.</p>

<p style="top:101px;left:57px;" class="ft292">hunt among the ploughed fields tonight” – and he plunged <br/>downwards through the bushes, to the stream at the bottom <br/>of the valley. There he checked, for he heard the yell of the <br/>Pack hunting, heard the bellow of a hunted Sambhur and <br/>the snort as the buck turned at bay. Then there were wicked, <br/>bitter howls from the young wolves: “Akela! Akela! Let the <br/>Lone Wolf show his strength. Room for the leader of the <br/>Pack! Spring, Akela!”</p>
<p style="top:269px;left:70px;" class="ft290">The Lone Wolf must have sprung and missed his hold, for </p>
<p style="top:290px;left:57px;" class="ft292">Mowgli heard the snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the <br/>Sambhur knocked him over with his fore foot.</p>
<p style="top:332px;left:70px;" class="ft290">He did not wait for anything more, but dashed on, and the </p>
<p style="top:353px;left:57px;" class="ft292">yells grew fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where <br/>the villagers lived.</p>
<p style="top:395px;left:70px;" class="ft290">“Bagheera spoke truth,” he panted, as he nestled down in </p>
<p style="top:416px;left:57px;" class="ft291">some cattle fodder by the window of a hut. “Tomorrow is one <br/>day both for Akela and for me.”</p>
<p style="top:458px;left:70px;" class="ft290">Then he pressed his face close to the window and watched the </p>
<p style="top:479px;left:57px;" class="ft291">fire on the hearth. He saw the husbandman’s wife get up and <br/>feed it in the night with black lumps, and when the morning <br/>came and the mists were all white and cold, he saw the man’s <br/>child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside with earth, fill it <br/>with lumps of red-hot charcoal, put it under his blanket and <br/>go out to tend the cows in the byre.</p>
<p style="top:605px;left:70px;" class="ft290">“Is that all?” said Mowgli. “If a cub can do it, there is nothing </p>
<p style="top:626px;left:57px;" class="ft291">to fear” – so he strode round the corner and met the boy, took <br/>the pot from his hand and disappeared into the mist while the <br/>boy howled with fear.</p>
<p style="top:689px;left:70px;" class="ft290">“They are very like me,” said Mowgli, blowing into the </p>
<p style="top:710px;left:57px;" class="ft292">pot, as he had seen the woman do. “This thing will die if <br/>I do not give it things to eat” – and he dropped twigs and <br/>dried bark on the red stuff. Halfway up the hill he met </p>

<p style="top:206px;left:57px;"  class="ft300">held up the fire pot.</p>
<p style="top:227px;left:70px;"  class="ft300">“Good! Now, I have seen men thrust a dry branch into that </p>
<p style="top:248px;left:57px;"  class="ft302">stuff, and presently the Red Flower blossomed at the end of it. <br/>Art thou not afraid?”</p>
<p style="top:290px;left:70px;"  class="ft300">“No. Why should I fear? I remember now – if it is not a </p>

<p style="top:374px;left:57px;"  class="ft302">dipping dry branches into it to see how they looked. He found <br/>a branch that satisfied him, and in the evening, when Tabaqui <br/>came to the cave and told him rudely enough that he was wanted <br/>at the Council Rock, he laughed till Tabaqui ran away.

<p style="top:500px;left:57px;"  class="ft301">the leadership of the Pack was open, and Shere Khan with his <br/>following of scrap-fed wolves walked to and fro openly being <br/>flattered. Bagheera lay close to Mowgli, and the fire pot was <br/>between Mowgli’s knees. When they were all gathered together, <br/>Shere Khan began to speak – a thing he would never have dared <br/>to do when Akela was in his prime.</p>
<p style="top:626px;left:70px;"  class="ft300">“He has no right,” whispered Bagheera. “Say so. He is a dog’s </p>

<p style="top:731px;left:70px;"  class="ft300">“Seeing that the leadership is yet open, and being asked to </p>

<p style="top:122px;left:70px;"  class="ft310">There were yells of “Silence, thou man’s cub!” – “Let him </p>
<p style="top:143px;left:57px;"  class="ft312">speak. He has kept our Law” – and at last the seniors of the <br/>Pack thundered: “Let the Dead Wolf speak.” When a leader <br/>of the Pack has missed his kill, he is called the Dead Wolf as <br/>long as he lives, which is not long.</p>
<p style="top:227px;left:70px;"  class="ft312">Akela raised his old head wearily:<br/>“Free People, and ye too, jackals of Shere Khan, for twelve </p>
<p style="top:269px;left:57px;"  class="ft312">seasons I have led ye to and from the kill, and in all that time <br/>not one has been trapped or maimed. Now I have missed my <br/>kill. Ye know how that plot was made. Ye know how ye brought <br/>me up to an untried buck to make my weakness known. It <br/>was cleverly done. Your right is to kill me here on the Council <br/>Rock, now. Therefore, I ask, who comes to make an end of the <br/>Lone Wolf? For it is my right, by the Law of the Jungle, that <br/>ye come one by one.”</p>
<p style="top:437px;left:70px;"  class="ft310">There was a long hush, for no single wolf cared to fight Akela </p>
<p style="top:458px;left:57px;"  class="ft313">to the death. Then Shere Khan roared: “Bah! What have we to <br/>do with this toothless fool? He is doomed to die! It is the man <br/>cub who has lived too long. Free People, he was my meat from <br/>the first. Give him to me. I am weary of this man-wolf folly. He <br/>has troubled the jungle for ten seasons. Give me the man cub, or <br/>I will hunt here always, and not give you one bone. He is a man, <br/>a man’s child, and from the marrow of my bones I hate him!”</p>
<p style="top:605px;left:70px;"  class="ft310">Then more than half the Pack yelled: “A man! A man! What </p>
<p style="top:626px;left:57px;"  class="ft310">has a man to do with us? Let him go to his own place.”</p>
<p style="top:647px;left:70px;"  class="ft310">“And turn all the people of the villages against us?” clamoured </p>
<p style="top:668px;left:57px;"  class="ft312">Shere Khan. “No, give him to me. He is a man, and none of us <br/>can look him between the eyes.”</p>

<p style="top:290px;left:57px;"  class="ft323">would kill him here! In truth, I have lived too long. Some of ye <br/>are eaters of cattle, and of others I have heard that, under Shere <br/>Khan’s teaching, ye go by dark night and snatch children from <br/>the villager’s doorstep. Therefore I know ye to be cowards, and <br/>it is to cowards I speak. It is certain that I must die, and my life <br/>is of no worth, or I would offer that in the man cub’s place. <br/>But for the sake of the Honour of the Pack – a little matter <br/>that by being without a leader ye have forgotten – I promise <br/>that if ye let the man cub go to his own place, I will not, when <br/>my time comes to die, bare one tooth against ye. I will die <br/>without fighting. That will at least save the Pack three lives. <br/>More I cannot do, but if ye will, I can save ye the shame that <br/>comes of killing a brother against whom there is no fault – a <br/>brother spoken for and bought into the Pack according to the <br/>Law of the Jungle.”</p>
<p style="top:605px;left:70px;"  class="ft320">“He is a man – a man – a man!” snarled the Pack, and most </p>

<p style="top:332px;left:70px;"  class="ft330">Mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit </p>
<p style="top:353px;left:57px;"  class="ft332">and crackled, and whirled it above his head among the cower-<br/>ing wolves.</p>
<p style="top:395px;left:70px;"  class="ft330">“Thou art the master,” said Bagheera, in an undertone. “Save </p>
<p style="top:416px;left:57px;"  class="ft330">Akela from the death. He was ever thy friend.”</p>
<p style="top:437px;left:70px;"  class="ft330">Akela, the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy </p>
<p style="top:458px;left:57px;"  class="ft332">in his life, gave one piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood <br/>all naked, his long black hair tossing over his shoulders in <br/>the light of the blazing branch that made the shadows jump <br/>and quiver.</p>
<p style="top:542px;left:70px;"  class="ft330">“Good!” said Mowgli, staring round slowly. “I see that ye </p>
<p style="top:563px;left:57px;"  class="ft333">are dogs. I go from you to my own people – if they be my own <br/>people. The Jungle is shut to me, and I must forget your talk <br/>and your companionship; but I will be more merciful than <br/>ye are. Because I was all but your brother in blood, I promise <br/>that when I am a man among men I will not betray ye to men <br/>as ye have betrayed me.” He kicked the fire with his foot, and <br/>the sparks flew up. “There shall be no war between any of us <br/>in the Pack. But here is a debt to pay before I go.” He strode <br/>forward to where Shere Khan sat blinking stupidly at the flames, <br/>and caught him by the tuft on his chin. Bagheera followed in </p>

<p style="top:80px;left:57px;"   class="ft342">case of accidents. “Up, dog!” Mowgli cried. “Up, when a man <br/>speaks, or I will set that coat ablaze!”</p>
<p style="top:122px;left:70px;"  class="ft340">Shere Khan’s ears lay flat back on his head, and he shut his </p>
<p style="top:143px;left:57px;"  class="ft340">eyes, for the blazing branch was very near.</p>
<p style="top:164px;left:70px;"  class="ft340">“This cattle killer said he would kill me in the Council, </p>
<p style="top:185px;left:57px;"  class="ft342">because he had not killed me when I was a cub. Thus and thus, <br/>then, do we beat dogs when we are men. Stir a whisker, Lungri, <br/>and I ram the Red Flower down thy gullet!” He beat Shere Khan <br/>over the head with the branch, and the tiger whimpered and <br/>whined in an agony of fear.</p>
<p style="top:290px;left:70px;"  class="ft340">“Pah! Singed jungle cat – go now! But remember when next I </p>
<p style="top:311px;left:57px;"  class="ft342">come to the Council Rock, as a man should come, it will be with <br/>Shere Khan’s hide on my head. For the rest, Akela goes free to <br/>live as he pleases. Ye will <i>not</i> kill him, because that is not my will. <br/>Nor do I think that ye will sit here any longer, lolling out your <br/>tongues as though ye were somebodies, instead of dogs whom I <br/>drive out – thus! Go!” The fire was burning furiously at the end <br/>of the branch, and Mowgli struck right and left round the circle, <br/>and the wolves ran howling with the sparks burning their fur. At <br/>last there were only Akela, Bagheera and perhaps ten wolves that <br/>had taken Mowgli’s part. Then something began to hurt Mowgli <br/>inside him, as he had never been hurt in his life before, and he <br/>caught his breath and sobbed, and the tears ran down his face.</p>
<p style="top:563px;left:70px;"  class="ft340">“What is it? What is it?” he said. “I do not wish to leave the </p>
<p style="top:584px;left:57px;"  class="ft340">jungle, and I do not know what this is. Am I dying, Bagheera?”</p>
<p style="top:605px;left:70px;"  class="ft340">“No, Little Brother. That is only tears such as men use,” said </p>
<p style="top:626px;left:57px;"  class="ft342">Bagheera. “Now I know thou art a man, and a man’s cub no <br/>longer. The Jungle is shut indeed to thee henceforward. Let <br/>them fall, Mowgli. They are only tears.” So Mowgli sat and <br/>cried as though his heart would break, and he had never cried <br/>in all his life before.</p>
<p style="top:731px;left:70px;"  class="ft340">“Now,” he said, “I will go to men. But first I must say fare-</p>
<p style="top:752px;left:57px;"  class="ft340">well to my mother” – and he went to the cave where she lived </p>

<p style="top:122px;left:70px;"  class="ft352">“Ye will not forget me?” said Mowgli.<br/>“Never while we can follow a trail,” said the cubs. “Come to </p>
<p style="top:164px;left:57px;"  class="ft352">the foot of the hill when thou art a man, and we will talk to <br/>thee – and we will come into the croplands to play with thee <br/>by night.”</p>
<p style="top:227px;left:70px;"  class="ft350">“Come soon!” said Father Wolf. “Oh, wise little frog, come </p>

<p style="top:269px;left:70px;"  class="ft350">“Come soon,” said Mother Wolf, “little naked son of mine </p>
<p style="top:290px;left:57px;"  class="ft352">– for, listen, child of man, I loved thee more than ever I loved <br/>my cubs.”</p>
<p style="top:332px;left:70px;"  class="ft350">“I will surely come,” said Mowgli, “and when I come it will </p>
<p style="top:353px;left:57px;"  class="ft351">be to lay out Shere Khan’s hide upon the Council Rock. Do not <br/>forget me! Tell them in the jungle never to forget me!”</p>
<p style="top:395px;left:70px;"  class="ft350">The dawn was beginning to break when Mowgli went down </p>
